# "Kinethall" is social-media app, focused on posting pictures and share daily life of our animals
My goal was creating place where people would be able to share they animels daily life with others, adopt or support those which are still in shelters. Project is in "master" branch, not "main" because of wrong VCS settings. The app has implemented SplashScreen, MainActivity - (UI with choosing Sign Up or Sing In activities), Register, Login and activity with many fragments such as Home - (posts and images of animals).

Some samples how it's looks like on phone in dark and light mode:

App can be run by importing all files as project in Android Studio in build it by gradle itself. 

# Requires at least Android Lollipop 5.1.1
